This is a code repository for a voice controlled news app powered by https://alan.app/, following the tutorial by Adrian Hajdin in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqw3OftE5sA&t=1538s

I am not the original creator nor do I own the rights of this web app, but rather I'd like to use this code to showcase the result of what I have learned from Adrian Hajdin, to whom I thank greatly for sharing his knowledge.
